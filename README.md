# PRODIGY_SD_04
# Sudoku Solver

This C++ program solves Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (also called "boxes", "regions", or "blocks") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

## Features

- **Input**: Accepts a predefined Sudoku grid with empty cells represented by `0`.
- **Output**: Prints the solved Sudoku grid to the console if a solution exists.
- **Algorithm**: Uses backtracking to explore possible solutions efficiently.
